        <p>In HTML, A self-closing tag is a type of tag that need not to be closed by closing tag, which means there is no separate closing tag for it as tag.
            Elements that don't have any content are called empty elements.

            Empty elements can be "closed" in the opening tag like this: br.</p>
            Example: <font color="yellow">&lt;img&gt;</font> ,  <font color="yellow">&lt;input&gt;</font> , <font color="yellow">&lt;br&gt;</font>.</p>

        <font color="white"><h3>5. Difference between block and inline?</h3></font>
        <p>A block element always begins on a new line and extends to left and right, and it takes the full width available on the webpage. Browsers automatically add some space(margin) before and after element.
            Examples of block elements are <font color="yellow">&lt;div&gt;</font>, <font color="yellow">&lt;p&gt;</font>, <font color="yellow">&lt;h1&gt;</font>to<font color="yellow">&lt;h6&gt;</font>, <font color="yellow">&lt;table&gt;</font> and <font color="yellow">&lt;form&gt;</font> etc.
            An inline element does not begin on a new line. It only takes the space that is necessary for it.
            Examples of inline elements are <font color="yellow">&lt;a&gt;</font>, <font color="yellow">&lt;span&gt;</font>, <font color="yellow">&lt;img&gt;</font>, <font color="yellow">&lt;input&gt;</font>, <font color="yellow">&lt;label&lt;</font> etc.

            <font color="white"> <h3>6. Difference between &lt;em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;?</h3></font>
        <p>The <font color="yellow">&lt;strong&gt;</font> and <font color="yellow">&lt;em&gt;</font> tags are used for emphasizing parts of a text.
            The <font color="yellow">&lt;strong&gt;</font> tag should be used to indicate strong importance, or urgency, like to indicate key phrases in a text for someone skimming it.
            The <font color="yellow">&lt;em&gt;</font> tag should be used to represent stress emphasis, like when you'd read the emphasized text in a different tone of voice. Both tags can be used together, where it makes sense.
